  <h3>What we've been learning</h3>

<h4>Week 1 </h4>
We've created our own blogs with <b>Jekyll</b>, <b>Markdown</b>, <b>HTML </b>and <b>CSS</b>. We've learnt about keeping our HTML <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">dry</a> and maintaining a separation of concerns. We hosted our site on <b>GitHub</b> and we learnt how to operate <b>Git</b> from the command line (on Terminal or on <b>Nitrous.io</b>).

<h4>Week 2 </h4>
We delved in <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Javascript libraries</b> to make our own API feed. We used Development tools to find out why sometimes our client-side code stopped working. We learnt about <b>DOM manipulation</b> and about responsive websites.

<h4>Week 3 </h4>
Despite just learning Javascript, we started to learn <b>Node.js</b> through Node School's <a href="http://nodeschool.io">learnyounode</a>. We learnt about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous calls.
