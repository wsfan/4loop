  <h3>What we've learnt</h3>

<h4>Week 1 </h4>
We've created our own blogs with <b>Jekyll</b>, <b>Markdown</b>, <b>HTML </b>and <b>CSS</b>. We've learnt about keeping our HTML <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">dry</a> and maintaining a separation of concerns. We hosted our site on <b>GitHub</b> and we learnt how to operate <b>Git</b> from the command line (on Terminal or on <b>Nitrous.io</b>).

<h4>Week 2 </h4>
We delved in <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Javascript libraries</b> (such as <b> jQuery UI</b>) to make our own API feed. We used Development tools to find out why sometimes our client-side code stopped working. We learnt about <b>DOM manipulation</b> and about responsive websites.

<h4>Week 3 & 4 </h4>
Despite just learning Javascript, we started to learn <b>Node.js</b> through Node School's <a href="http://nodeschool.io">learnyounode</a>. We created our own <b>web server</b> and <b>time server</b> delivering the time in both ISO and Unixtime format. We learned about using <b>Heroku</b> to host a piece of Javascript to pull data from the Twitter API. From there, we used an <b>Ajax</b> function and <b> DOM manipulation</b> to pull the Twitter data and print tweeted images to a web page.
