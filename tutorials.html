<b>Each day the tutor of every group presents a short 5 minute tutorial (i.e. a pedagogical presentation). <br>
Below you'll find a sample of our group's tutorials.</b>

<br>
<b> 1. Google Chrome development tools</b><br>
<sub>Originally presented by Piri on Friday, 20th June.</sub><br>

<br>
<b>a.</b> <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> has in-built development tools that  aid the creation and editing of webpages.<br>
<b>b.</b> Access the tools by opening Google Chrome and following through to: View > Tools > Dev Tools (or on a Mac, View > Developer > Development Tools).<br>
<b>c.</b> The Dev Tools bar appears at the bottom of the page providing the page's source code in a collapsable and organised format. <br>
<b>d.</b> The Dev Tools bar highlights errors in coding and you can edit the source code and see changes real-time (n.b. these edits do not affect the actual webpage in any way).
