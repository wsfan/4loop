    <h3>What we've been learning</h3>
  </header>

<h4>Week 1 </h4>
We've created our own blogs with Jekyll, Markdown, HTML and CSS. We've learnt about keeping our HTML dry and maintaining a separation of concerns. We hosted our site on GitHub and we learnt how to operate Git from the command line (on Terminal or on Nitrous.io).

<h4>Week 2 </h4>
We delved in Javascript, JQuery libraries and JSON(P) to make our own API feed. We used Development tools to find out why sometimes our client-side code stopped working. We learnt about DOM manipulation and about responsive websites.

<h4>Week 3 </h4>
Despite just learning Javascript, we started to learn Node.js through Node School's learnyounode. We learnt about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous calls.
