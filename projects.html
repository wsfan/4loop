  <h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Week 1: Jekyll Blog and Site </h4>

<b>Wan said:</b><br>
"The first week was definitely trial by fire. When we were told we had to make a blog, everyone thought that it would be a simple task but then we were told we had to use Jekyll and GitHub — something that was new to everyone.<br><br>At the beginning we were very happy with just a page that worked but as the days went on, the groups became more discerning and demanding. In the end, all of us had great (and operational!) sites."

<h4>Week 2: Guardian API </h4>
<b>Ross said:</b><br>
"Coming in on Monday morning with the confidence of producing our blog coursing through Team 4Loop's veins, we were swiftly brought back to earth when faced with an all too familiar feeling of abject confusion. Our second project was to produce a widget using the Guardian API. This meant firstly finding out what an API is and how they work. <br><Br>The other news was that Stephan Fowler, a developer for The Guardian, would be coming in on Thursday to review our code. This shortened our deadline and meant we would have to produce work of a high standard. Through lots of hardwork (and doughnuts) we managed to get something resembling a final product."

<h4>Weeks 3 and 4: Twitter App</h4>
<b> Michael said:</b></br>
"We were presented with the Twitter API project – a large step up from anything we had attempted before that would require us to flex some full-stack web development muscles. The task was to create a website that would allow a user to type any hashtag and be presented with a gallery of images corresponding to that hashtag. We spent the morning trawling tutorials and blogs trying to grapple with the problem and begin to break the task down. After a day of failing to make any real progress the cohort made the decision to spend the week in the pits learning <b>Node.js</b><br><br>

So commenced <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">learnyounode:</a> a command-line-based series of 13 gruelling tutorials (at least for us) that demand a far better knowledge of JavaScript than any of us possess(ed). Never the less we powered through them one by one as a cohort, finishing on Friday afternoon. At the start of Week 4, we plunged back in to the Twitter API project, with heightened sprits knowing that another learnyounode task wasn’t lying in wait. Throughout the week the teams worked collaboratively together to solve problems we encountered. So Friday came. We hadn't finish. But we were close: we managed to serve a list of image URLs to a blank page, hosted on Heroku, which is arguably the hardest part of the task in what was the hardest task we’d been presented. <br><br>
 All in all it was a tough week but we learned a lot about server-side applications as well as teaching yourself how to do something when you don’t know what that something is.

<h4>Week 5: d3 Map</h4>
<b> Piri said:</b></br>
"Robin Houston from kiln.it kindly came in and presented us with our challenge for the week, which was to create a d3 map that visually represented the varying prices of retail and wholesale cocaine across the globe using data provided by the United Nations.<br><br>

It is fair to say that we were initially quite overwhelmed, but after some initial research we realised how easy d3 makes data visualisation. We acknowledged that the ease of something like this depends on the format of the data and how easy it is to manipulate. Thankfully, Robin manipulated the raw UN data and presented it to us in a format that was easy to use in this case.<br><br>

We managed to visualise a gradient change showing the varying prices across the globe by simply following some tutorials - it was surprisingly straight forward. What we struggled with was creating a toggle option that allowed for the map to change between retail price and wholesale price.
