  <h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Week 1: Jekyll Blog and Site </h4>
<b>Wan said:</b><br>
"The first week was definitely trial by fire. When we were told we had to make a blog, everyone thought that it would be simple but then we were told we had to use Jekyll and GitHub â€” something that was new to everyone.<br><br>At the beginning we were very happy with just a page that worked but as the days went on, the groups became more discerning and demanding. In the end, all of us had great (and working!) sites."

<h4>Week 2: Guardian API </h4>
<b>Ross said:</b><br>
"Coming in on Monday morning with the confidence of producing our blog coursing through Team 4Loop's veins, we were swiftly brought back to earth when faced with an all too familiar feeling of abject confusion. Our second project was to produce a widget using the Guardian API. This meant firstly finding out what an API is and how they work. <br><Br>The other news was that Stephan Fowler, a developer for The Guardian, would be coming in on Thursday to review our code. This shortened our deadline and meant we would have to produce work of a high standard. Through lots of hardwork (and doughnuts) we managed to get something resembling a final product."
