  <h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Week 1 </h4>
We created this website which runs on Jekyll an is hosted at GitHub (although we own the domain).

This is Wan had to say about the project:
"The first week was definitely trial by fire. When we were told we had to make a blog, everyone thought that it would be simple but then we were told we had to use Jekyll and GitHub â€” something that was new to everyone. At the beginning we were very happy with just a page that worked but as the days went on, the groups got more fussy and all of us ended up with great (and working!) sites."

<h4>Week 2 </h4>
We had to create our own web app that took data from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk">The Guardian</a>. 

<h4>Week 3 </h4>
We are currently making an app that can take selected images from <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
