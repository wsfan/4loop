  <h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Week 1: Jekyll Blog and Site </h4>
<b>Wan said:</b><br>
"The first week was definitely trial by fire. When we were told we had to make a blog, everyone thought that it would be simple but then we were told we had to use Jekyll and GitHub — something that was new to everyone.<br><br>At the beginning we were very happy with just a page that worked but as the days went on, the groups became more discerning and demanding. In the end, all of us had great (and working!) sites."

<h4>Week 2: Guardian API </h4>
<b>Ross said:</b><br>
"Coming in on Monday morning with the confidence of producing our blog coursing through Team 4Loop's veins, we were swiftly brought back to earth when faced with an all too familiar feeling of abject confusion. Our second project was to produce a widget using the Guardian API. This meant firstly finding out what an API is and how they work. <br><Br>The other news was that Stephan Fowler, a developer for The Guardian, would be coming in on Thursday to review our code. This shortened our deadline and meant we would have to produce work of a high standard. Through lots of hardwork (and doughnuts) we managed to get something resembling a final product."

<h4>Weeks 3 & 4: Twitter App</h4>
We are currently making an app that can take selected images from <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
<br><b> Michael said:</b></br>
"We were presented with the Twitter API project – a large step up from anything we had attempted before that would require us to flex some full-stack web development muscles.
The task was to create a website that would allow a user to type any hashtag and be presented with a gallery of images corresponding to that hashtag. Out of the blocks we spent the morning trawling tutorials and blogs trying to grapple with the problem and begin to break the task down. After a day of failing to make any real progress the cohort made the decision to spend the week in the pits learning node.js (Google’s environment that allows the running of JavaScript files on the sever side). 
So commenced <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">learnyounode:</a> a command-line-based series of 13 gruelling tutorials (at least for us) that demand a far better knowledge of JavaScript than any of us possess(ed). Never the less we powered through them one by one as a cohort, finishing on Friday afternoon. 

Week 4. After last week’s false start, we plunged back in to the Twitter API project, with heightened sprits knowing that another learnyounode task wasn’t lying in wait.
Throughout the week the teams worked collaboratively together to solve problems we encountered. The 4loop team was split in to Piri and I (Michael) working on calling the relevant Twitter API and serving it to a specific hashtag request. Ross the Boss worked on the interface between the server and the front end as well as the design of the site. Wan ploughed on with the www.4loop.co.uk blog site, creating some new features and ironing out all the creases. 
So Friday happened. We didn’t finish. But we were close: we managed to serve a list of image urls to a blank page, hosted on Heroku, which is arguably the hardest part of the task in what was the hardest task we’d been presented thus far. All in all it was a tough week, but we learned a lot about server-side applications as well as teaching yourself how to do something when you don’t know what that something is. 
If the team has time we’ll complete this project before August 1st and post the link here. Keep an eye out.
