Week 2 - Day 1

We were assigned a new challenge - the Guardian challenge. This is a real challenge used by The Guardian when interviewing new developers. Of course, Team 4loop was not the least bit phased. 

We started out ambitously watching and reading as many tutorials and web lessons as we could to get a grip of what we needed to do. It was a hectic day of learning and swearing. Eventually we learned some stuff and set out a plan to implement over the following days. Gonna be a busy week.
