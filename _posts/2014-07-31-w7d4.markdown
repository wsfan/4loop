T minus 1 day until presentation.

We have a webapp that works in the browser that shows cards with info from local bars using Google data.

We have also worked on emulation so that we can eventually make this a phone app. Emulation has proved quite fiddly in that many packages needed to be downloaded and decisions needed to be made about Android or ios.

By the end of the day we had an emulation of the webapp in ios.
