Today we were supposed to deploy <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to create our blog but we discovered very quickly that Jekyll is, for beginners, both hard to install and use. In order to have something to present at the afternoon presentation, we cheated. We created a blog using our collective HTML knowledge and we borrowed an online template.

On our illegitimate website we added APIs from Instagram, Twitter and Google Maps but tomorrow we plan to integrate Jekyll into our blog.
