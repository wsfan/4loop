Today we vowed to follow the class syllabus and have <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> running on our site (like all the other teams). After some false starts, we managed to install Jekyll *and* <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. However the website was not free from problems as none of our posts appeared and our links did not work.

Our plan tomorrow is to have our blog post links working (so that our website actually serves a function).
