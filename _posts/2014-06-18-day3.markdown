After presenting our website yesterday, we agreed that we should have <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> running on our site in order to 'comply' with the class syllabus. After some false starts, we managed to install Jekyll *and* <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. However, the website was not free from problems as none of our posts appeared and our links did not work.

In the evening we were very grateful to Greg Tebbutt, the first of our guest speakers, who came to speak about his journey from university to <a href="http://sparrho.com/">Sparro</a> where he currently works.
