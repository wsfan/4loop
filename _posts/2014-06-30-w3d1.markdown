Monday of Week 3 is the beginning of a two-week project. Using <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> we are going to create our own server that pulls data from the <a href="www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> API and then presents tweeted images on a gallery page. We are going to be learning the Node language which is Javascript for servers. It's as complicated as it sounds.
