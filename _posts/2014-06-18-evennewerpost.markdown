Today we were supposed to use Jekyll to create our blog. We discovered very quickly that Jekyll is hard to install and, in order to present something at our afternoon presentation, we cheated. We created a blog using our collective HTML knowledge and from an online template.

We plan to integrate Jekyll into our blog tomorrow...
