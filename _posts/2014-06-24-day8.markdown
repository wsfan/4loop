Two of 4loop's gang have neglected to attend - one being investigated for some sort of (supposedly criminal) charges and the other not feeling right after a hard night on the town. This didn't stir the confidence of the remaining team, Ross and Piri (aka Team 2loop). Today felt much more focused than yesterday but was only so due to time spent yesterday frantically working out and researching the work that needed to be done. We seem to have covered the minimium requirements of the Guardian challenge and are now simply looking to add some flair and style (as has come to be expected of our team...).
